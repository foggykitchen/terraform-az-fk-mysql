# Azure MySQL with Terraform/OpenTofu - Training Examples

This directory contains all progressive examples used with the **terraform-az-fk-mysql** module.
The examples are designed as **incremental building blocks** for private Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server architectures.

These examples are part of the **[FoggyKitchen.com training ecosystem](https://foggykitchen.com/courses-2/)** and are meant to be applied independently for learning and experimentation.

---

## 🧭 Example Overview

| Example | Title | Key Topics |
|:-------:|:------|:-----------|
| 01 | **Private Access with Delegated Subnet** | MySQL Flexible Server, VNet injection, delegated subnet, Private DNS |
| 02 | **Private Endpoint** | MySQL Flexible Server, FoggyKitchen Private Endpoint module, Private DNS Zone Group |

Each example can be applied independently, but the recommended learning path is sequential:

```text
01 → 02
```

## ⚙️ How to Use

Each example directory contains:

- Terraform/OpenTofu configuration (`.tf`)
- A focused `README.md` explaining the goal of the example
- A `terraform.tfvars.example` file with placeholder values

To run an example:

```bash
cd examples/01_private_access_delegated_subnet
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
tofu init
tofu plan
tofu apply
```

## 🧩 Design Principles

- One example = one architectural goal
- MySQL is isolated from networking concerns in the root module
- Networking, Private DNS, and Private Endpoints are composed with dedicated FoggyKitchen modules
- Examples avoid hidden dependencies between directories

These examples intentionally avoid:

- Full landing zones
- Application schemas or seed data
- Hidden dependencies between example directories
