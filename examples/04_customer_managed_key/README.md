# Example 04: Customer-Managed Key Encryption

In this fourth MySQL example, we deploy an **Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server**
using **Terraform/OpenTofu** with **customer-managed key encryption at rest**.
The server is injected into a delegated database subnet, uses a linked Azure Private DNS Zone,
and receives a Key Vault key and user-assigned managed identity from composed FoggyKitchen modules.

This example creates the Key Vault with `terraform-az-fk-key-vault`, creates the Key Vault key
with `terraform-az-fk-key-vault-key`, creates the user-assigned identity with
`terraform-az-fk-managed-identity`, and grants Key Vault crypto access with `terraform-az-fk-rbac`.

## Architecture Overview

![Customer-managed key architecture](04_cmk_key_vault_architecture.jpg)

This deployment creates:

- A dedicated **Azure Resource Group**
- One **Key Vault** using `terraform-az-fk-key-vault`
- One **RSA Key Vault key** using `terraform-az-fk-key-vault-key`
- One **user-assigned managed identity** using `terraform-az-fk-managed-identity`
- Key Vault RBAC assignments using `terraform-az-fk-rbac`
- One **Azure VNet** using `terraform-az-fk-vnet`
- One application subnet for future client workloads
- One database subnet delegated to `Microsoft.DBforMySQL/flexibleServers`
- One **Private DNS Zone** using `terraform-az-fk-private-dns`
- One **MySQL Flexible Server** using the local `terraform-az-fk-mysql` module
- One sample database named `foggydb`

This example demonstrates the secure-by-default MySQL encryption pattern where the database
service uses a managed identity to access a Key Vault key by ID.

---

## Deployment Steps

Copy the example variables file and set a strong MySQL administrator password:

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

If you reuse a shared Azure training tfvars file, make sure it also provides
`mysql_admin_password`. No key material or secrets are hardcoded in this example.

Initialize and apply the Terraform/OpenTofu configuration:

```bash
tofu init
tofu plan
tofu apply
```

After a successful deployment, OpenTofu will output:

- The MySQL Flexible Server ID
- The MySQL FQDN
- Whether CMK encryption is enabled
- The Key Vault ID
- The Key Vault key version ID and resource ID
- The user-assigned managed identity ID, principal ID, and client ID
- The created database IDs

These outputs make it easy to verify that MySQL encryption is connected to the expected
Key Vault key and managed identity.

---

## Runtime Notes

The Key Vault uses Azure RBAC and purge protection, which are required for a realistic MySQL
CMK setup. The principal running OpenTofu receives `Key Vault Crypto Officer` so it can create the
key, and the MySQL user-assigned identity receives `Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User`
so the service can wrap and unwrap the data encryption key.

The MySQL module references the versioned Key Vault key ID. The key itself is created in the
example composition layer through `terraform-az-fk-key-vault-key`.

## Azure Console And Runtime Verification

### MySQL Data Encryption

Confirm that MySQL Flexible Server data encryption uses the customer-managed key.

### MySQL Identity

Confirm that the user-assigned managed identity is assigned to the MySQL Flexible Server.

### MySQL Networking

Confirm that the server is integrated with the delegated database subnet and uses private access.

### Key Vault

Confirm that the Key Vault exists with soft-delete and purge protection enabled.

### Key Vault Key

Confirm that the RSA key used by MySQL encryption exists in the Key Vault.

### Key Vault RBAC

Confirm that the current principal and MySQL managed identity have the required Key Vault
crypto roles.

### Private DNS

Confirm that the Private DNS Zone is linked to the VNet created by `terraform-az-fk-vnet`.
